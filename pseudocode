What I want the code to do:
    Sort through given numbers and determine if the number is a prime number or not
    "Yes," if prime. "No," if not a prime.

How?
    Lets say the given numbers are numbers 1 to 50
    Since a prime number has a factor of 1 and the number itself without any remainders
    Since we already know that 1 is not a prime number then if n < 2 then print, "no"
    We check if the number by trial division:
        Divide n by 2 and if its divisible by 2 without a remainder it is immediately not a prime number
        If otherwise it is a prime number

Okay the method above is not enough to determine if it is a prime number not
    Why?
        Because its only checking it if its an even number


How do factors work?
    If n is not a prime then it can be factored as:
        n = a x b

        Where a and b are factors of n
    
    So can we use the square root of n and just find out if it has any factors below that?
        Lets take the equation above: 
            (I hate math)
                If both a and b is greater than the square root of n
                Then their product a x b would be greater than n (not possible)

            So for checking whether n is not a prime its enough to look for possible a values up to the square root of n
              - so if a divides with n and it has no remainder then there should be a partner which is b
              therefore n is not a prime


So there fore the code should work like this:

For each n from 1 to 50 do:
    if n < 2 then 
        print "no"
    else
        let isPrime = True
        For i = 2 to squar root of n do:
            if n % i == 0 then
                let isPrime = False
                done
        if isPrime then
            print "yes"
        else
            print "no"
